# CS260
Scheduler Website made for the CS260 class I took in 2026
The goal of this repository is to contain all the code needed for my website

The instructions said to modify this file again, so here it is!



Elevator Pitch:
    I get sick of planning my day on planners that require too much info. You have to put in dates, exact times, why, repeating, etc. It get's exhausting, and honestly I sometimes just want to put in that I plan on working on x for an hour at this time and follow that with another hour doing something else. I plan on creating a scheduling app that is super simple and easy to use, with an interface that allows you to easily scroll between days, have a task list on the side if you want, and that you can grab and move events as easily as left clicking rather then having to manually change every peice of info in a planning block. This would also include sharable goals to other users and would allow you to see other people's public goals.
